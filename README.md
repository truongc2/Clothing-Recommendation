# Clothing-Recommendation

Repository for clothing recommendation service. The product is a web application to host a model to recommend a particular article of clothing to an online customer. The app would then be integrated into a Chrome extension. Currently, only a classification model is implemented.

Still a work in progress. Other possible ideas include using a KNN algorithm to find "similiar" articles of clothing to "solve" the cold start problem.
